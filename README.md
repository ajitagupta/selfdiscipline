# How to Build Unbreakable Self-discipline

Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do what you should do whether you feel like it or not. Nothing great is really achieved without it. Luckily, self-discipline is a skill that can be learnt and cultivated with continuous practice. Until it becomes automatic, just like any other skill.

To accomplish a greater goal you have to step outside your comfort zone. Pratice tolerating small amounts of discomfort. Small sacrifices add up creating strength in the face of temptation. Your self-discipline will grow. Your tolerance for discomfort will improve and you will take steps towards your ultimate goal.
## Clarity

Most people have no idea what they really want. You need goals for your health, your career, your finances, your relationships, your personal and professional development and your community and spiritual growth. Create an effective action plan. Clarity is the most important single quality of goal-setting and perhaps the most important single quality of success. Instead of fuzzy goals like more money, better health and happiness be specific about exactly how much money you want to earn in a specific period of time or what level of health, fitness or weight that you desire. If you don't set specific goals you can't fail to achieve them because they are so vague. This is a major reason for failure.
Next, set deadlines. If it's a large goal set sub-deadlines. What if you don't achieve your goal by the deadline? Set another deadline! You must have a target time before you set off.
