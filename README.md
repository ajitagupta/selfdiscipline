# How to Build Unbreakable Self-discipline

Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do what you should do whether you feel like it or not. Nothing great is really achieved without it. Luckily, self-discipline is a skill that can be learnt and cultivated with continuous practice. Until it becomes automatic, just like any other skill.

To accomplish a greater goal you have to step outside your comfort zone. Practice tolerating small amounts of discomfort. Small sacrifices add up creating strength in the face of temptation. Your self-discipline will grow. Your tolerance for discomfort will improve and you will take steps towards your ultimate goal.

## Goal-setting and Clarity

Your problem is to bridge the gap between where you are now and the goals you intend to reach. You need goals for your health, your career, your finances, your relationships, your personal and professional development and your community and spiritual growth.

Clarity is the most important single quality of goal-setting and perhaps the most important single quality of success. Instead of fuzzy goals like more money, better health and happiness be specific about exactly how much money you want to earn in a specific period of time or what level of health, fitness or weight that you desire. The more comprehensive your list, the more motivated you will become, the more intense will be your desire, the more you will believe it is possible. The 80/20 rule says the first 20% of time you spend planning and organizing your plan will be worth 80% of the time and effort required to achieve your goal. Use this rule to organize your list by priority, sequence and deadlines. If it's a large goal set sub-deadlines. There are no unreaonsable goals, only unreasonable deadlines. What if you don't achieve your goal by the deadline? Set another deadline! You must have a target time before you set off.
